# Typing-speed
This project resembles the popular "Typing speed" game which is available on many websites on different forms <br>
The user tries to write a given text as fast as possible and after 60 seconds, the displayed results indicates how many words were written and the percentage of correct words.<br>
The most difficult functionality to implement was making sure that the right characters or sequences from the two texts are compared. As the program moves to the next word after a new white space was introduced, there are numerous scenarios in which inconsistencies between the positions of the compared characters/words can occur. To controll all possible scenarios, I used numerous index variables and arrays, boolean flags and multiple conditions.
