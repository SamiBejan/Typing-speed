# Typing-speed
This project resembles the popular "Typing speed" game which is available on many websites on different forms <br>
The user tries to write a given text as fast as possible and after 60 seconds, the displayed results indicates how many words were written and the percentage of correct words.<br>
The most difficult functionality to implement was checking in real-time if a word was correct or not. 
This difficulty resulted from the fact that there were different situations that this function had to address -> after completing a new word, after deleting characters from a previously completed word, 
after changing characters from a previously correctly or wrongly completed word. I controlled all these scenarios by using index variables and arrays, boolean flags and conditions.
